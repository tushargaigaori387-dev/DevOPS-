	Wt is maven
	==========
	
	Ø It's a automation build tool and project management tool
	Ø Primarily maven used for java projects
	Ø It helps in building , packaging and managing  dependencies of ur project 
	Ø Developed by Apache software foundation 
	Ø It will work on the principle convention over configuration (it is going to reducing the need to write lengthy build scripts 

Real time analogy
===============

	Ø Think maven is a recipe book + grocery manager 
	Ø Recipe book = how to cook / how to build/run ur project 
	Ø Grocery manager= it will provide all the ingredients to prepare the recipe / automatically it will download libraries 


Why maven
==========

	Ø Before maven people used Ant tool (another build tool )
	Ø Ant required manual xml scripting for everything 
	Ø Dependency management was a headache (you have to downloads and add jar files manually)

	Maven solved this by
	=================

	Ø Automatic dependency management 
	Ø Standard directory structure 
	Ø Easy to integrating with cicd tools .
	Ø Reproducible builds ( same everywhere)


Maven lifecycle
=============

	Ø Maven has three built-in lifecycle 

	1. Clean:- it will remove previous builds files
	2. Build:- it will compile ur code, it will test , pkg, deploys
	3. Site:- it will generate project documentation 


Each lifecycle has phases
====================

	1. Validate:- it will validation project 
	2. Compile:- compile source code
	3. Test:- it will run unit tests
	4. Package:- it will build jar/war file for pkaging ur app
	5. Verify:- it will run checks
	6. Install:- it will install in local repo
	7. Deploy:- push to remote repo(like nexus, artifact repo, maven central)


Maven project structure 
====================

POM.xml file
==========

	Ø Pom:- project object model
	Ø It is a heart for maven, without having pom.xml you cant work with maven

Maven repositories 
================

	Ø Maven uses repositories to store libraries 

	1. Local repo:- it will be on your system.
	2. Central repo:- default repo for maven
	3. Remote repo:- where we are going to store all ur war/jar files . Like nexus

Maven commands
===============

	1. Mvn clean:- clean project
	2. Mvn compile:- it will compile src
	3. Mvn package:- it will pkg ur src into jar/war file
	4. Mvn install :- it will into local repo
	5. Mvn deploy:- it will upload/push ur jar/war file into remote repo(nexus)
	6. Mvn dependency:tree :- it will show you despondency hierarchy 


Advantage of maven
=================

	Ø Easy dependency management
	Ø Reusable standard project structure
	Ø Portable builds across  env
	Ø Rich pulgin ecosystem
	Ø Work well with cicd tools


Files in maven
===========

	Ø War file:- web archive :- it is for maven based app
	Ø Jar file:- java archive:- it is for java based app
Ear file:- enterprise archive:- it is for enterprise level app

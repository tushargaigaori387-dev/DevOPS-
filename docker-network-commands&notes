Docker network
=============


Wt is docker network?
==================

	Ø Network is to establish a communication between two persons, two servers, two app's and two machines
	Ø A docker network allows containers to communicate with each other, the host machine or outside the world
	Ø Without networks containers are isolated.

Why docker networks?
===================

	Ø To connect containers, ex:- app + db 
	Ø To control communication (isolate containers for security)
	Ø To expose services  (like a web app accessible on browser 


Types of docker networks
=====================

	1. Bridge network 
  ================

	Ø It is called as  default network
	Ø It is for prod use
	Ø Containers get their own ip add and they can talk to each other if on the same bridge 

	2. Host network
  ==============

	Ø Containers shares hosts network namespace
	Ø Containers won't get their own ip add

	3. None network
  ===============

	Ø Containers completely isolated 
	Ø Means there is no any internet connectivity to the containers 
It is used for whenever you want to keep secure ur app from the internet

Docker draw backs
===============

	Ø Docker containers are very light weight 
	Ø Containers are not self-healing
	Ø Docker will not support load balancing 
Docker will not support auto scaling:- horizontal as:- increasing servers, vertical as:- increasing cpu,ram,rom
